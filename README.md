Ball Kick Game is a project that I designed with 3 other colleauges for our school traversal project

The goal is to control a stick figure and kick a ball back and forth as it moves across the screen. 

You use the arrow keys to move the figure and kick with the left leg for when the ball approaches from the left, and right for when it's coming from the right. 

The game ends after three missed kicks, so be precise and quick.

Note that the ball moves faster after each sucessful kick :)
